# Prisoner-s-Dilemma

This is a simple prisoner's dilemma project I created in my ITP class. There are 4 players, one that I coded
mean (always defects), nice (always cooperates), Tit For Tat (does the previous player's move).
These "players" play eachother and it shows the results of those matches.
